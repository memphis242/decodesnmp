# `decodesnmp` - A Tool to Decode SNMP Packets Provided as Hex Encodings
There are obviously `tcpdump` and `tshark`/Wireshark to do this, but they operate on `.pcap` files. There are times in an SNMP developer/tester/hacker's life when `.pcap`s aren't available or the right input. I certainly faced such a woe, and hence this tool was born.
