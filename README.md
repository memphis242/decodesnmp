# `decodesnmp` - A Tool to Decode SNMP Packets Provided as Hex Encoded Input
The tools `tcpdump` and `tshark`/Wireshark probably come to mind, but they operate on `.pcap` files. There are times in an SNMP developer/tester/hacker's life when `.pcap`s aren't available or the right input. I certainly endured such a woes, hence this tool was conceived.
